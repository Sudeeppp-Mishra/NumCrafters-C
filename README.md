# NumCrafters - Numerical Methods in C

Welcome to **NumCrafters**, a collection of numerical methods implemented in C. This repository contains various algorithms and methods that Iâ€™ve explored and created. The goal of this project is to better understand and practice numerical analysis techniques using C programming.

## Methods Implemented

### 1. Bisection Method
- **File**: `bisection_falsePositionMethod.c`
- **Description**: This program implements the **Bisection Method** for solving nonlinear equations. It's used to find the root of a function where the function changes sign over a specified interval.

### 2. False Position Method
- **File**: `bisection_falsePositionMethod.c` 
- **Description**: Another method used to find roots of nonlinear equations. The False Position Method is similar to the Bisection Method, but it improves the approximation by using a secant line.
>Note: Both Bisection and False Position Methods are implemented on the same file as both have same working except the approximation formula...

## Requirements
- **Compiler**: GCC or any other C compiler
- **Operating System**: Compatible with any OS that supports C programming (Linux, Windows, macOS)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sudeepp-Mishra/NumCrafters.git
